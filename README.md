# PLC-Projects


This is where I keep Ladder Logic code made in OpenPLC editor


# Water Sensor

This program was written in OpenPLC Editor and is based on this blog https://instrumentationblog.com/tank-water-level-measurement/
I was introduced to Set and Reset coils.

The Set Coil remains true until the reset coil returns the set coil back to false

If both the set and reset coils are true then the last coil that is scanned determines the logic.

# XOR GATE

A simple XOR gate in Ladder Logic made with OpenPLC Editor

# First_LD_program

This is the first ladder logic program that I wrote in OpenPLC Editor. This is based on the getting started exercise found here: https://www.openplcproject.com/reference/basics/first-project

I learned how to make variables and simple Ladder Logic programs using the OpenPLC Editor. ALso, I learned how to compile a program and use OpenPLC Runtime.
